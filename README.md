# Problem Statement

Design a KV Store built on top of a SQL (relational) database. The store exposes APIs to `GET`, `PUT`, `DEL` keys. Along with these core functiona, there should be an API to set `TTL` to an existing key, post which the key is auto-deleted from the store. Scale this KV store **1 million** concurrent API calls and a total storage of **5000 TB**.

# Requirements

<!--rs-->

_The problem statement is something to start with, be creative and dive into the product details and add constraints and features you think would be important._

<!--re-->

## Core Requirements

- should be able to `GET`, `PUT`, `DEL`, `TTL` on keys
- upon expiration the key should be auto-deleted
- should handle **1 million** concurrent transactions
- max storage of one KV store would be **5000 TB**

## High Level Requirements

<!--hs-->

- make your high-level components operate with **high availability**
- ensure that the data in your system is **durable**, not matter what happens
- define how your system would behave while **scaling-up** and **scaling-down**
- make your system **cost-effective** and provide a justification for the same
- describe how **capacity planning** helped you made a good design decision
- think about how other services will interact with your service
<!--he-->

## Micro Requirements

<!--ms-->

- ensure the data in your system is **never** going in an inconsistent state
- ensure your system is **free of deadlocks** (if applicable)
- ensure that the throughput of your system is not affected by **locking**, if it does, state how it would affect
<!--me-->

# Output

## Design Document

<!--ds-->

Create a **design document** of this system/feature stating all critical design decisions, tradeoffs, components, services, and communications. Also specify how your system handles at scale, and what will eventually become a chokepoint.

Do **not** create unnecessary components, just to make design look complicated. A good design is **always simple and elegant**. A good way to think about it is if you were to create a spearate process/machine/infra for each component and you will have to code it yourself, would you still do it?

<!--de-->

## Prototype

To understand the nuances and internals of this system, build a prototype that

- expose `GET`, `PUT`, `DEL`, `TTL` over HTTP server
- simulate concurrent transactions and measure the throughput

### Recommended Tech Stack

This is a recommended tech-stack for building this prototype

| Which    | Options                     |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| Language | Golang, Java, C++           |
| Database | Relational Database - MySQL |

### Keep in mind

These are the common pitfalls that you should keep in mind while you are building this prototype

- have a primary key to your tables otherwise the entire table might get locked
- auto-deletion of keys at scale is tricky, think about it well

# Outcome

## Learned

- SQL Transactions
- Database Locking
- Scaling by sharding
